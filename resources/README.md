As I don't think I can upload here the original textures from the game, you can take them yourself from your game installation by copying the textures folder from:
%appdata%/.minecraft/versions/\<your_version\>/\<your_version\>.jar/assets/minecraft/\
to:\
\<mineflat\>/res/\
You can use WinRAR for example to navigate inside the .jar file.
