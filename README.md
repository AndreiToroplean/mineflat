## Installation
Only Windows is supported for now (but if you feel adventurous, I don't think it's too hard to get it running on another platform). 

- First, install Python 3.8 from [the official website](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.10/python-3.8.10-amd64.exe).
- Then, clone the repo in a folder of your choosing.
- From the newly created `mineflat` dir, in a Windows Powershell, run:
  - `python -m venv venv`
  - `.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
  - `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Launching
- From the `mineflat` dir, in a Windows Powershell, run:
  - `.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
  - `python -m mineflat`

Enjoy!
